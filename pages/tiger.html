                  "There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the
                  continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera
                  tigris sondaica). The largest of all the Asian big cats,
                  tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for
                  hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey. A tiger can
                  consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average,
                  tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all
                  the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced
                  within five months. Tigers generally gain independence at
                  around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age
                  three or four for females and four or five years for males.
                  Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all cubs do
                  not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to
                  reach up to 20 years of age in the wild. Males of the larger
                  subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds.
                  For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper
                  range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males
                  are heavier than females. Tigers are mostly solitary, apart
                  from associations between mother and offspring. Individual
                  tigers have a large territory, and the size is determined
                  mostly by the availability of prey. Individuals mark their
                  domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing.
                  Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from
                  poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss. They are
                  forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human
                  populations."
