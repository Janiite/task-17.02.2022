                  "Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have
                  distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They
                  use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet
                  other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing,
                  among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow
                  tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked,
                  and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear
                  and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended
                  teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and
                  move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can
                  also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants
                  even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.
                  Two genetically different African species exist: the savanna
                  elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of
                  characteristics that differentiate them both. The African
                  savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the
                  Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a
                  comparable, smaller size. Asian elephants differ in several
                  ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct
                  physical differences between them. For example, Asian
                  elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped
                  ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants
                  have tusks, while both male and female African elephants grow
                  tusks. Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into
                  complex social structures of females and calves, while male
                  elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor
                  groups. A single calf is born to a female once every four to
                  five years and after a gestation period of 22 monthsâ€”the
                  longest of any mammal. Calves are cared for by the entire herd
                  of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal
                  herd for the rest of their lives, while males leave the herd
                  as they reach puberty. Forest elephants' social groups differ
                  slightly and may be comprised of only an adult female and her
                  offspring. However, they may congregate in larger groups in
                  forest clearings where resources are more abundant. Elephants
                  need extensive land areas to survive and meet their ecological
                  needs, which includes food, water, and space. On average, an
                  elephant can feed up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of
                  pounds of plant matter in a single day. As a result, as they
                  lose habitat, they often come into conflict with people in
                  competition for resources."
